# ShopFast
Implemented a real-time inventory synchronization pipeline for ShopFast by integrating data from PostgreSQL, MongoDB, CSVs, and POS systems using Databricks, Kafka, and Delta Lake. This solution reduced order cancellations from 15% to 3% and improved inventory sync latency from 2 hours to just 5 minutes, recovering $1.6M in annual revenue.
